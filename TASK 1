Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets.
It allows them to predict new, similar data without explicit programming for each task.
Machine learning finds applications in diverse fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and automating tasks.
Machine learning's impact extends to autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, enhancing their adaptability in dynamic environments.
This approach marks a breakthrough where machines learn from data examples to generate accurate outcomes, closely intertwined with data mining and data science.
Machine learning is important because it allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.
This ability to learn from data and adapt to new situations makes machine learning particularly useful for tasks that involve large amounts of data, complex decision-making, and dynamic environments.
